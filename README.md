`perceptia` development support repo
====================================

Aim of this repo is to have a place to keep stuff related to development of `perceptia` that should
not be commited to main repo (spell files? workspaces?  project files?).

It can also serve as discussion board for general problems around `perceptia`.

If number of repositories grows support for `repo` or `submodules` may be added.
